# python_practice

This is the primary respository for the Python practice that I have done between 07/15/2024 - 08/09/2024. Great first introduction to basics of another object-oriented language (similar to R).

As of 08/16/2024, Python basics had become stale so I started looking for other means for CS enrichment.

Uploaded are lessons and practice files for Python enrichment.
